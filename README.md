# KeyboardTweaks
 Some keyboard tweaks to make the life easier.

 I love to writing code, and also I love to work with mechanical keyboards. As most of them have ANSI layout, I miss some keys that I usually need to use with standard ISO layout. 
 I don't have the time and pleasure to learn new layout, so I started to make the life easier for me. 
 
 It started with the less and greater signs, which are often a separated key between left shift and Y.
 After a while I started to create emulation for numblock and later also added emulation for the delete key.
